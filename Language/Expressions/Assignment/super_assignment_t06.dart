 * Let g be the method currently executing, and let C be the class in which
 * g was looked up. Let Sdynamic be the superclass of C. The expression e is
 * evaluated to an object o. Then, the setter v = is looked up inSdynamic with
 * respect to the current library. The body of v = is executed with its formal
 * parameter bound to o and this bound to this.
 * @description Checks that expression e is evaluated even if super.v=
