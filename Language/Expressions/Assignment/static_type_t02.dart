/**
 * @assertion Evaluation of an assignment of the form e1.v = e2 proceeds as
 * follows:
 * ...
 * Let T be the static type of e1. It is a static type warning if T does not
 * have an accessible instance setter named v = unless either:
 *  • T or a superinterface of T is annotated with an annotation denoting a
 *    constant identical to the constant @proxy defined in dart:core. Or
 *  • T is Type, e1 is a constant type literal and the class corresponding to e1
 *    has a static setter named v =.
 * @description Checks that there is no static warning if the class of e1 does
 * not have a setter named v but is annotated with @proxy.
