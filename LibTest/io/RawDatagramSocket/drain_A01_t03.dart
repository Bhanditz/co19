 * @assertion Future<E> drain<E>([E futureValue ])
 * Discards all data on the stream, but signals when it's done or an error
 * occurred.
 *
 * When subscribing using drain, cancelOnError will be true. This means that the
 * future will complete with the first error on the stream and then cancel the
 * subscription.
 *
 * In case of a done event the future completes with the given futureValue.
 *
 * @description Checks that future is completed with null, when futureValue is
