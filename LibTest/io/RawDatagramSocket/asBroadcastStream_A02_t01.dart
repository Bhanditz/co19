 * Stream<RawSocketEventT> asBroadcastStream({

 *     void onCancel(StreamSubscription<T> subscription)
 * })
 * Returns a multi-subscription stream that produces the same events as this.
 * . . .
 * If onListen is provided, it is called with a subscription-like object that
 * represents the underlying subscription to this stream. It is possible to
 * pause, resume or cancel the subscription during the call to onListen.
 * It is not possible to change the event handlers, including using
 * StreamSubscription.asFuture.
