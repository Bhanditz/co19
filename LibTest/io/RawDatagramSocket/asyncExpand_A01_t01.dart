/**
 * @assertion Stream<E> asyncExpand<E>(Stream<E> convert(T event))
 * Transforms each element into a sequence of asynchronous events.
 *
 * Returns a new stream and for each event of this stream, do the following:
 *
 * - If the event is an error event or a done event, it is emitted directly by
 *   the returned stream.
 * - Otherwise it is an element. Then the convert function is called with the
 *   element as argument to produce a convert-stream for the element.
 * - If that call throws, the error is emitted on the returned stream.
 * - . . .
 * - Otherwise, this stream is paused and convert-stream is listened to. Every
 *   data and error event of the convert-stream is emitted on the returned
 *   stream in the order it is produced. When the convert-stream ends, this
 *   stream is resumed.
 *
 * @description Checks that the convert function is called with the element as
 * argument to produce a convert-stream for the element, and a convert-stream
 * is emitted on the returned stream in the order it is produced.
