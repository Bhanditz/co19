/**
 * @assertion Stream<RawSocketEvent> distinct([bool equals(T previous, T next)])
 * Skips data events if they are equal to the previous data event.
 *
 * The returned stream provides the same events as this stream, except that it
 * never provides two consecutive data events that are equal. That is, errors
 * are passed through to the returned stream, and data events are passed through
 * if they are distinct from the most recently emitted data event.
 *
 * Equality is determined by the provided equals method. If that is omitted,
 * the '==' operator on the last provided data element is used.
 *
 * If equals throws, the data event is replaced by an error event containing the
 * thrown error. The behavior is equivalent to the original stream emitting the
 * error event, and it doesn't change the what the most recently emitted data
 * event is.
 *
 * @description Checks that the returned stream contains only the last event
 * when equals is omitted and this stream was canceled before method distinct
 * usage.
