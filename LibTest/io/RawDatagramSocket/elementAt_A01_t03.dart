/**
 * @assertion Future<RawSocketEvent> elementAt(int index)
 * Returns the value of the indexth data event of this stream.
 *
 * Stops listening to the stream after the indexth data event has been received.
 *
 * Internally the method cancels its subscription after these elements. This
 * means that single-subscription (non-broadcast) streams are closed and cannot
 * be reused after a call to this method.
 *
 * If an error event occurs before the value is found, the future completes with
 * this error.
 *
 * @description Checks that if receiver RawDatagramSocket receives sent events,
 * method 'elementAt' returns correct value of 0, 1, 2, and 3 indexes.
