 * @assertion Future<E> drain<E>([E futureValue ])

 * When subscribing using drain, cancelOnError will be true. This means that the

 * subscription.
 *
 * In case of a done event the future completes with the given futureValue.
 *
 * @description Checks that when all events are received with this stream,
 * [drain] discards all this events from the stream and returns given value.
