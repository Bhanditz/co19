/**
 * @assertion String iterableToFullString(Iterable iterable,
 * [String leftDelimiter = '(', String rightDelimiter = ')'])
 * Converts an Iterable to a string.
 * Converts each elements to a string, and separates the results by ", ". Then
 * wraps the result in leftDelimiter and rightDelimiter.
 * Unlike iterableToShortString, this conversion doesn't omit any elements or
 * puts any limit on the size of the result.
 * Handles circular references where converting one of the elements to a string
 * ends up converting iterable to a string again.
 * @description Checks that IterableBase.iterableToFullString() converts each
 * elements to a string, and separates the results by ", ".
