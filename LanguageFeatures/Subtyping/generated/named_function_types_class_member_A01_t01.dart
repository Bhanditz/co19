 * @assertion A type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written T0 <: T1) when:
 * Named Function Types: T0 is U0 Function<X0 extends B00, ..., Xk extends B0k>
 *   (T0 x0, ..., Tn xn, {Tn+1 xn+1, ..., Tm xm})
 *
 * and T1 is U1 Function<Y0 extends B10, ..., Yk extends B1k>(S0 y0, ..., Sn yn,
 * {Sn+1 yn+1, ..., Sq yq})
 * and {yn+1, ... , yq} subsetof {xn+1, ... , xm}
 * and Si[Z0/Y0, ..., Zk/Yk] <: Vi[Z0/X0, ..., Zk/Xk] for i in 0...n
 * and Si[Z0/Y0, ..., Zk/Yk] <: Tj[Z0/X0, ..., Zk/Xk] for i in n+1...q, yj = xi
 * and U0[Z0/X0, ..., Zk/Xk] <: U1[Z0/Y0, ..., Zk/Yk]
 * and B0i[Z0/X0, ..., Zk/Xk] === B1i[Z0/Y0, ..., Zk/Yk] for i in 0...k
 * where the Zi are fresh type variables with bounds B0i[Z0/X0, ..., Zk/Xk]
 * @description Check that if T0 and T1 satisfies the rules above, then T0 is
 * subtype of T1
